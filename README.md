# CSS Positioning

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo to work local.
2. Open up the `index.html` file in your browser to see the exercises.
3. Complete each exercise by adding a new ruleset, or multiple rulesets, in order to style the elements according to the instructions.

- Make sure you only edit the `my-styles.css` file. Edits to other files are not allowed.
- Make sure your selectors are specific enough to only target the exercise you're working on.

4. When you're done, do not push your changes instead compress your code and submit to Lea.
